# v0.1, 2020-11-08, jw	- initial draught, finding and printing selected nodes to the terminal...
# v0.2, 2020-11-08, jw	- duplicate the selected nodes in their superpaths, write them back.
# v0.3, 2020-11-21, jw	- find "meta-handles"
# v0.4, 2020-11-26, jw	- alpha and trim math added. trimming with a striaght line implemented, needs fixes.
#                         Option 'cut' added.
# v0.5, 2020-11-28, jw	- Cut operation looks correct. Dummy midpoint for large arcs added, looks wrong, of course.
# v1.0, 2020-11-30, jw	- Code completed. Bot cut and arc work fine.
# v1.1, 2020-12-07, jw	- Replaced boolean 'cut' with a method selector 'arc'/'line'. Added round_corners_092.inx
#                         and started backport in round_corners.py -- attempting to run the same code everywhere.
# v1.2, 2020-12-08, jw  - Backporting continued: option parser hack added. Started effect_wrapper() to prepare self.svg
# v1.3, 2020-12-12, jw  - minimalistic compatibility layer for inkscape 0.92.4 done. It now works in both, 1.0 and 0.92!
# v1.4, 2020-12-15, jw  - find_roundable_nodes() added for auto selecting nodes, if none were selected.
#                         And fix https://github.com/jnweiger/inkscape-round-corners/issues/2
# 2021-01-15, Mario Voigt - removed oboslete InkScape 0.92.* stuff
#
# Bad side-effect: As the node count increases during operation, the list of
# selected nodes is incorrect afterwards. We have no way to give inkscape an update.

Rounded Corners

This extension operates on selected sharp corner nodes and converts them to a fillet (bevel,chamfer).
An arc shaped path segment with the given radius is inserted smoothly.
The fitted arc is approximated by a bezier spline, as we are doing path operations here.
When the sides at the corner are straight lines, the operation never move the sides, it just shortens them to fit the arc.
When the sides are curved, the arc is placed on the tanget line, and the curve may thus change in shape.

Selected smooth nodes are skipped.
Cases with insufficient space (180deg turn or too short segments/handles) are warned about.

          For a closed subpath, the last node and the first node are identical. Then, the second last node may be still at the
          same location if it has a handle. If so, we take the third last instead. Gah. It has a certain logic...

          In case of the node_idx being the last node, we already know that the subpath is not closed,
          we use 0 as the next node.

          The direction sn.prev.dir does not really point to the coordinate of the previous node, but to the end of the
          next-handle of the prvious node. This is the same when there are straight lines. The absence of handles is
          denoted by having the same coordinates for handle and node.
          Same for next.dir, it points to the next.prev handle.

          The exact implementation here is:
          - sn.next.handle is set to a relative vector that is the tangent of the curve towards the next point.
            we implement four cases:
            - if neither node nor next have handles, the connection is a straight line, and next.handle points
              in the direction of the next node itself.
            - if the curve between node and next is defined by two handles, then sn.next.handle is in the direction of the
              nodes own handle,
            - if the curve between node and next is defined one handle at the node itself, then sn.next.handle is in the
              direction of the nodes own handle,
            - if the curve between node and next is defined one handle at the next node, then sn.next.handle is in the
              direction from the node to the end of that other handle.
          - when trimming back later, we move along that tangent, instead of following the curve.
            That is an approximation when the segment is curved, and exact when it is straight.
            (Finding exact candidate points on curved lines that have tangents with the desired circle
            is beyond me today. Multiple candidates may exist. Any volunteers?)

        *  Fix it so that big endian systems write a little endian file
	Also, write null characters after the label in stl_write_binary

Tue Aug  1 03:25:46 PDT 1995  Anthony Martin <amartin@engr.csulb.edu>

        *  Change stl_fill_holes so that duplicate facets are not likely
	to be generated.  Should improve quality of filled holes.

Wed Aug  2 16:56:03 PDT 1995  Anthony Martin <amartin@engr.csulb.edu>

	*  Add support for generating shared vertices
	*  Move fclose(stl->fp) to stl_open()

	*  Don't use area any more to see whether or not the normal should
	be calculated.  Just go ahead and calculate the normal, and let the
	code in stl_normalize vector() take care of the case of a normal 
	with zero area.
	*  Changes call to stl_check_normal_vector() in stl_add_facet() so
	that it doesn't check the normal vector after it adds it.  Just
	caused accounting error for normals fixed.

Wed Nov  1 08:39:17 PST 1995  Anthony Martin <amartin@engr.csulb.edu>
        *  Initialize normal vector to 0,0,0 when a new facet is added.

Sat Jan 20 23:43:01 PST 1996  Anthony Martin <amartin@engr.csulb.edu>
        *  stlinit.c  Initialize pointers to NULL.  Check whether they have
	been allocated before free()ing them.  Duh.
	
Thu Jan 25 16:02:57 PST 1996 Anthony Martin <amartin@engr.csulb.edu>
        *  shared.c Add   fclose(fp); to stl_write_off().
	*  stl_io.c Add dxf write capability
	*  shared.c Add vrml write capability

Fri Jul 26 11:31:50 PDT 1996 Anthony Martin <amartin@engr.csulb.edu>
	*  Update normals after rotation
	*  Add code to calculate the volume of the part

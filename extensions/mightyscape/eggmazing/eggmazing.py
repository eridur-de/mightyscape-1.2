# Draw a cylindrical maze suitable for plotting with the Eggbot
# The maze itself is generated using a depth first search (DFS)

# Written by Daniel C. Newman for the Eggbot Project
# Improvements and suggestions by W. Craig Trader
# 20 September 2010

# Update 26 April 2011 by Daniel C. Newman
#
# 1. Address Issue #40
#    The extension now draws the maze by columns, going down
#    one column of cells and then up the next column. By using
#    this technique, the impact of slippage is largely limited
#    the the West and East ends of the maze not meeting.  Otherwise,
#    the maze will still look quite well aligned both locally and
#    globally.  Only very gross slippage will impact the local
#    appearance of the maze.
#
#    Note that this new drawing technique is nearly as fast as
#    the prior method.  The prior method has been preserved and
#    can be selected by setting self.hpp = True.  ("hpp" intended
#    to mean "high plotting precision".)
#
# 2. Changed the page dimensions to use a height of 800 rather
#    than 1000 pixels.
#
# 3. When drawing the solution layer, draw the ending cell last.
#    Previously, the starting and ending cells were first drawn,
#    and then the solution path itself.  That caused the pen to
#    move to the beginning, the end, and then back to the beginning
#    again to start the solution path.  Alternatively, the solution
#    path might have been drawn from the end to the start.  However,
#    just drawing the ending cell last was easier code-wise.
